We are actively working on:

### **User Search System**
You will be able to search for usernames directly on the main page.  
If a user does not exist, the system will return:

- **Available**  
- **Not Found**  
- **Banned**  
- **For Sale**  
- or other dynamic responses  

This allows anyone to claim or request a username.
